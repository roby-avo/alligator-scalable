nhs wales shared services partnership,Childrens Continuing Care Framework,"The Children’s Continuing Care Service (“CCCS”) has been developed to strengthen core children’s continuing care provision across the three counties of Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire (Hywel Dda health community).
In order to support the provision of direct patient care to children and young people, the multi-agency Complex Needs panels in each county will scrutinise applications and make the recommendation to commission the provision of direct client care by the partner organisations.
Direct client care will be commissioned for two (2) categories of client need. The categories are not mutually exclusive but acknowledge that there is often a predominant need:
- Children and young people with complex medical/physical health needs (where these needs are predominant)
- Children and young people with additional needs e.g., learning disability, behaviors that challenge /ASD, Mental Health (where these needs are predominant)
Within each of the two categories of client need described above, there will be two levels of care that can be commissioned which may be delivered in the home, education or social care setting:
- Basic care – this would include a range of basic health and social care tasks and it is anticipated that all children and young people for whom the service is being commissioned would require this aspect of care.
- Enhanced care - this would include additional specialist health and social care tasks, in addition to the basic care needs of the child/young person.
The service provided by the Hywel Dda University Health Board will undertake the clinical assessment, monitoring and supervision of the health care package, as well as train and assess the competency of care provider staff.

kent county council,SC23187 - Key Street Junction Improvement Works,"Kent County Council (the Council) is the largest local authority in England covering an area of 3,500 square kilometres. It has an annual expenditure of over £1bn on goods and services and a population of 1.6m. The Council provides a wide range of personal and strategic services on behalf of its residents, operating in partnership with the NHS Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group, 12 district councils, and 289 parish/town councils. KCC consists of four directorates:

 • Adult Social Care and Health;

• Children, Young People and Education;

• Growth, Environment and Transport; and

• Strategic and Corporate Services.

 This service is being commissioned on behalf of the Major Capital Programme Team which sits within the Growth, Environment and Transport directorate.

 The Key Street junction is located on the A249, to the north-east of the M2 Junction 5 heading towards the Isle of Sheppey.

 The A249 Key Street junction is a two-bridge oval shaped roundabout junction with slip roads on the southern side and connections to the A249, A2 Keycol Hill, Bobbing Hill, Sheppey Way and Chestnut Street. It serves the A2, village communities, and Sittingbourne town centre.

 Road users currently using the Key Street junction often experience high volumes of traffic, which results in significant vehicle queues and congestion. The volume of traffic at these junctions is expected to increase as a result of future growth in the surrounding area, which is set out in the local plan. KCC is proposing improvements to this junction through this project to reduce the impact of future growth, reduce congestion and address air quality issues.

 The Council has also previously procured improvement works for the adjacent Grovehurst Road Junction; works are expected to be completed by September 2024.
